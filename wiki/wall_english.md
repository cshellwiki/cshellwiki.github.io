# [Linux] Bash wall uso: Send messages to all logged-in users

## Overview
The `wall` command in Bash is used to send a message to all users currently logged into the system. This can be particularly useful for system administrators who need to communicate important information or alerts to all users at once.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `wall` command is as follows:

```bash
wall [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-n`: Suppresses the printing of the user's name before the message.
- `-s`: Sends the message to all users without waiting for them to read it.
- `-f`: Reads the message from a specified file instead of standard input.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Sending a simple message
To send a message directly from the command line, you can use:

```bash
wall "System maintenance will start in 10 minutes."
```

### Example 2: Sending a message from a file
If you have a message saved in a file, you can send it using:

```bash
wall < message.txt
```

### Example 3: Suppressing the username
To send a message without displaying the username, use the `-n` option:

```bash
wall -n "Attention: The server will be down for maintenance."
```

### Example 4: Sending a message with a delay
To send a message immediately without waiting for users to read it, use the `-s` option:

```bash
wall -s "Reminder: Please save your work."
```

## Tips
- Use `wall` sparingly to avoid overwhelming users with messages.
- Consider using `echo` with `wall` for more complex messages or formatting.
- Always notify users of important system events, such as maintenance or downtime, to ensure they are prepared.
