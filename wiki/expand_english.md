# [Linux] Bash expand uso equivalente: Convert tabs to spaces

## Overview
The `expand` command in Bash is used to convert tabs in a text file into spaces. This is particularly useful for ensuring consistent formatting in files, especially when working with code or text that will be displayed in environments where tab sizes may vary.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `expand` command is as follows:

```bash
expand [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-t, --tabs=N`: Set the number of spaces per tab to N (default is 8).
- `-i, --initial`: Convert tabs to spaces only at the beginning of each line.
- `-n, --no-tabs`: Suppress all tab characters in the output.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information about the command.

## Common Examples

1. **Basic Usage**: Convert tabs to spaces in a file named `example.txt`.
   ```bash
   expand example.txt
   ```

2. **Specify Tab Size**: Convert tabs to spaces with a custom tab size of 4.
   ```bash
   expand -t 4 example.txt
   ```

3. **Initial Tabs Only**: Convert tabs to spaces only at the beginning of each line in `example.txt`.
   ```bash
   expand -i example.txt
   ```

4. **Suppress Tabs**: Remove all tab characters from `example.txt`.
   ```bash
   expand -n example.txt
   ```

5. **Output to a New File**: Redirect the output to a new file called `output.txt`.
   ```bash
   expand example.txt > output.txt
   ```

## Tips
- When working with files that will be shared across different systems, consider using `expand` to maintain consistent formatting.
- Use the `-t` option to adjust the tab size according to your project's coding standards.
- Always check the output of the `expand` command by redirecting it to a new file before overwriting the original, to prevent data loss.
