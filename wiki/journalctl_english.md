# [Linux] Bash journalctl Uso: View and query system logs

## Overview
The `journalctl` command is a utility for querying and displaying messages from the journal, which is a component of the systemd system and service manager. It allows users to view logs generated by the system and applications, making it an essential tool for troubleshooting and monitoring system performance.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `journalctl` command is as follows:

```bash
journalctl [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-b` or `--boot`: Show logs from the current boot.
- `-f` or `--follow`: Continuously show new log entries as they are written.
- `-p` or `--priority`: Filter logs by priority level (e.g., `info`, `warning`, `error`).
- `--since`: Show logs since a specific date or time.
- `--until`: Show logs until a specific date or time.
- `-u` or `--unit`: Show logs for a specific systemd unit (e.g., a service).

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using `journalctl`:

1. **View all logs:**
   ```bash
   journalctl
   ```

2. **Show logs from the current boot:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -b
   ```

3. **Follow new log entries in real time:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -f
   ```

4. **Filter logs by priority level (e.g., errors only):**
   ```bash
   journalctl -p err
   ```

5. **Show logs since a specific date:**
   ```bash
   journalctl --since "2023-10-01"
   ```

6. **Show logs for a specific systemd service:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -u sshd.service
   ```

## Tips
- Use `-n` followed by a number to limit the output to the last N entries (e.g., `journalctl -n 100`).
- Combine options for more refined queries, such as `journalctl -b -p err` to see only error logs from the current boot.
- Redirect output to a file for further analysis: `journalctl > logs.txt`.
