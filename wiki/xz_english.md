# [Linux] Bash xz Uso equivalente: Comprimir y descomprimir archivos

## Overview
The `xz` command is a powerful tool used for compressing and decompressing files in the XZ format. It is known for its high compression ratio and is often used in scenarios where reducing file size is crucial, such as software distribution and archiving.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `xz` command is as follows:

```bash
xz [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-d`, `--decompress`: Decompress the specified files.
- `-k`, `--keep`: Keep the original files after compression or decompression.
- `-f`, `--force`: Force compression or decompression, even if the output file already exists.
- `-z`, `--compress`: Compress the specified files (this is the default action).
- `-9`: Use the maximum compression level (1-9, where 9 is the highest).

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `xz` command:

### Compress a File
To compress a file named `example.txt`:

```bash
xz example.txt
```

### Decompress a File
To decompress a file named `example.txt.xz`:

```bash
xz -d example.txt.xz
```

### Keep Original File
To compress a file while keeping the original:

```bash
xz -k example.txt
```

### Force Compression
To forcefully compress a file, overwriting any existing output file:

```bash
xz -f example.txt
```

### Maximum Compression
To compress a file using the highest compression level:

```bash
xz -9 example.txt
```

## Tips
- Use the `-k` option if you want to retain the original file after compression, especially when testing compression results.
- For batch processing, you can use wildcards. For example, `xz *.txt` will compress all `.txt` files in the current directory.
- Be mindful of disk space when compressing large files, as the process may require temporary space for both the original and compressed files.
