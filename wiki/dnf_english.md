# [Linux] Bash dnf Uso: Package management tool for RPM-based distributions

## Overview
The `dnf` command is a package manager for RPM-based Linux distributions, such as Fedora and CentOS. It is used to install, update, remove, and manage software packages on your system. `dnf` stands for Dandified YUM and is the next-generation version of the older `yum` package manager.

## Usage
The basic syntax for the `dnf` command is as follows:

```bash
dnf [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `install`: Installs a package.
- `remove`: Uninstalls a package.
- `update`: Updates all installed packages to their latest versions.
- `search`: Searches for a package by name or description.
- `info`: Displays detailed information about a package.
- `list`: Lists all available or installed packages.
- `clean`: Cleans up cached files to free up space.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `dnf` command:

### Installing a Package
