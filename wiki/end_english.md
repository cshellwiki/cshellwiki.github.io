# [Linux] Bash end usage: Terminate processes

## Overview
The `end` command in Bash is used to terminate running processes. It allows users to stop processes gracefully or forcefully, depending on the options used. This command is essential for managing system resources and ensuring that unwanted processes do not consume CPU or memory.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `end` command is as follows:

```bash
end [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Displays help information about the command and its options.
- `-v`, `--version`: Shows the version of the `end` command.
- `-f`, `--force`: Forces the termination of a process, even if it does not respond to a standard termination request.
- `-p`, `--pid`: Specifies the process ID of the process to terminate.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `end` command:

1. **Terminate a process by PID**:
   To terminate a process with a specific process ID (PID), use:
   ```bash
   end -p 1234
   ```

2. **Forcefully terminate a process**:
   If a process is not responding, you can forcefully terminate it:
   ```bash
   end -f -p 5678
   ```

3. **Display help information**:
   To see the help information for the `end` command, run:
   ```bash
   end --help
   ```

4. **Check the version of the command**:
   To find out which version of the `end` command you are using:
   ```bash
   end --version
   ```

## Tips
- Always try to terminate a process gracefully before using the force option to avoid data loss.
- Use the `ps` command to find the PID of the process you want to terminate.
- Consider using `pkill` or `killall` for terminating processes by name instead of PID for convenience.
