# [Linux] Bash mesg Uso: Control message reception

## Overview
The `mesg` command in Bash is used to control whether other users can send messages to your terminal. It allows you to enable or disable the ability for other users to write messages to your terminal session, which can be particularly useful in multi-user environments.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `mesg` command is as follows:

```bash
mesg [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `y`: Allows other users to send messages to your terminal.
- `n`: Disables message reception from other users.
- `--help`: Displays help information about the command and its options.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `mesg` command:

1. **Allow messages from other users:**
   ```bash
   mesg y
   ```

2. **Disable messages from other users:**
   ```bash
   mesg n
   ```

3. **Check the current message status:**
   ```bash
   mesg
   ```

4. **Display help information:**
   ```bash
   mesg --help
   ```

## Tips
- Use `mesg n` when you want to focus on your work without interruptions from other users.
- Remember to set `mesg y` if you are in a collaborative environment and want to receive important messages.
- Check your message status regularly, especially if you are in a shared terminal session, to ensure you are not missing any important communications.
