# [Linux] Bash endsw usage: End a script or command execution

## Overview
The `endsw` command in Bash is used to terminate the execution of a script or command based on specific conditions. It allows users to control the flow of their scripts by providing a way to exit from loops or functions when certain criteria are met.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `endsw` command is as follows:

```bash
endsw [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-h`, `--help`: Displays help information about the command.
- `-v`, `--version`: Shows the version of the command being used.

(Note: The `endsw` command is not a standard command in Bash; it is often used in conjunction with specific scripting contexts or frameworks.)

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `endsw` command:

### Example 1: Exiting a loop
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
        endsw
    fi
    echo $i
done
```
In this example, the loop will terminate when the variable `i` equals 5.

### Example 2: Conditional exit in a function
```bash
my_function() {
    if [ "$1" -lt 0 ]; then
        endsw
    fi
    echo "Positive number: $1"
}

my_function 10
my_function -5
```
Here, the function will exit if a negative number is passed as an argument.

### Example 3: Using with a case statement
```bash
case $1 in
    start)
        echo "Starting..."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Stopping..."
        endsw
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid option"
        endsw
        ;;
esac
```
In this case statement, the script will exit if an invalid option is provided or if the `stop` option is selected.

## Tips
- Always ensure that the conditions for using `endsw` are clearly defined to avoid unexpected exits.
- Use comments in your scripts to explain why and when you are using `endsw` for better readability.
- Test your scripts thoroughly to ensure that the `endsw` command is being triggered as expected in different scenarios.
