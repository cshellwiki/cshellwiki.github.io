# [Linux] Bash source equivalent: Execute commands from a file in the current shell

## Overview
The `source` command in Bash is used to execute commands from a specified file in the current shell environment. This is particularly useful for loading configuration files or scripts without starting a new shell session, allowing any changes made to the environment variables or functions to take effect immediately.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `source` command is as follows:

```bash
source [options] [file]
```

Alternatively, you can use the dot (`.`) command, which is a synonym for `source`:

```bash
. [file]
```

## Common Options
The `source` command does not have many options, but here are a couple of important ones:

- `-h`, `--help`: Display help information about the command.
- `-V`, `--version`: Show the version of the shell.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Sourcing a configuration file
To load environment variables from a configuration file, you can use:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This command will execute the commands in the `.bashrc` file, applying any changes to your current shell session.

### Example 2: Sourcing a script
If you have a script named `setup.sh` that sets up your environment, you can run:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

This will execute the commands in `setup.sh` in the current shell, allowing any variables or functions defined in the script to be available immediately.

### Example 3: Using the dot command
You can achieve the same result using the dot command:

```bash
. setup.sh
```

This is functionally identical to using `source`.

## Tips
- Always ensure that the file you are sourcing is executable and contains valid Bash commands to avoid errors.
- Use `source` for files that modify the current shell environment, such as setting environment variables or defining functions.
- If you want to see the output of the commands being executed in the sourced file, you can add `set -x` at the beginning of the file to enable debugging output.
