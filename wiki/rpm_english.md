# [Linux] Bash rpm uso equivalente: Gestor de paquetes para sistemas basados en RPM

## Overview
The `rpm` command is a powerful package management tool used in Linux distributions that utilize the RPM Package Manager. It allows users to install, uninstall, query, and manage software packages in `.rpm` format.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `rpm` command is as follows:

```bash
rpm [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-i`: Install a new package.
- `-e`: Remove an installed package.
- `-q`: Query a package to check if it is installed or to get information about it.
- `-U`: Upgrade an existing package to a newer version.
- `-v`: Verbose output, providing more details during execution.
- `-h`: Display hash marks (`#`) during installation or upgrade to indicate progress.

## Common Examples

### Install a Package
To install a package named `example.rpm`, use:
```bash
rpm -i example.rpm
```

### Remove a Package
To remove an installed package named `example`, run:
```bash
rpm -e example
```

### Query a Package
To check if a package named `example` is installed and get its details, use:
```bash
rpm -q example
```

### Upgrade a Package
To upgrade an existing package to a newer version from `example-new.rpm`, use:
```bash
rpm -U example-new.rpm
```

### List Installed Packages
To list all installed packages on the system, you can use:
```bash
rpm -qa
```

## Tips
- Always check for dependencies before installing a package, as `rpm` does not resolve them automatically.
- Use the `-v` option for more detailed output, which can help in troubleshooting issues during installation or removal.
- Consider using `yum` or `dnf` for package management tasks, as they handle dependencies and provide a more user-friendly interface over `rpm`.
